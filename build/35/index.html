        <p>Ira F. McCurry, a 45-year-old white man, was shot and killed Thursday, April 30, 1992, near the intersection of 102nd Street and Avalon Boulevard in Green Meadows. McCurry was shot in the head as he tried to stop looters from starting a fire in a liquor store that could have spread to the adjacent residence he shared with a friend. An Army veteran, McCurry had fallen on hard times before meeting county golf course maintenance worker John Huff two years ago. McCurry, who was homeless, was employed at the same golf course as part of a general relief workfare program when Huff took him into his Watts-area home. &#34;Over time, he became a part of my family,&#34; Huff, 50, said.</p>
